# PerlProjects
Repository for basic programs written while teaching myself Perl in my free time.


Currently my goal is to be able to write a program to open up .log files generated from Zsim benchmarks and to read the data generated and to analyze the data and present it in a readible format. 

I already have code written in python for this same project, but want to expand my knowledge and programming by learning to do the same thing in Perl.
